    ECO-OP software library to enable the reproducibility of a document produced in an ecosystem assessment.
</shortdesc>

<description>
The ECO-OP project was a collaboration between computer scientists,  fisheries scientists, and oceanographers to facilitate the deployment of  an Integrated Ecosystem Approach (IEA) to management of Large Marine  Ecosystems (LMEs). Here we provide the ECO-OP software library that we  developed from a Use Case for the Ecosystem Status Report for the U.S.  Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). We focus on the Climate  Forcing chapter of this report and build a PDF document that reports on  two climate indicators. The workflow is conducted within an IPython  Notebook. The general utility of this software package is to enable the  reproducibility of a scientific workflow that acquires data online,  processes and plots data, packages text and figures into a document, and  tracks provenance of derived data and the output document. The ECO-OP  project was a collaboration between Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and NOAA's Northeast  Fisheries Science Center, funded in 2010-2014 by the U.S. National Science Foundation #0955649.
